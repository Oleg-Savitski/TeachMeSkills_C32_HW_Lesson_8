Task 1:

Create a program to simulate the work of the clinic. Let there be three doctors in the clinic:
surgeon, therapist and dentist. Every doctor has a "cure" method, but every doctor treats
in his own way. Also provide for the "Patient" class with the "Treatment Plan" field
and the "Doctor" field. Create a Patient class object and add a treatment plan to the patient. The
therapist should create a method that will prescribe a doctor to the patient according
to the treatment plan:
If the treatment plan has code 1, appoint a surgeon and perform the treatment method.
If the treatment plan has code 2, appoint a dentist and perform the treatment method.
If the treatment plan has any other code, appoint a therapist and perform
the treatment method.
